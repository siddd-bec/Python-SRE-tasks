1. What is a Class?
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.

It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have.

Classes are defined using the class keyword.

Example:

python
Copy
class Dog:
    pass
2. What is an Object?
An object is an instance of a class.

When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object is created.

Objects are created using the class name followed by parentheses.

Example:

python
Copy
my_dog = Dog()  # my_dog is an object of the Dog class
3. What is self?
self is a reference to the current instance of the class.

It is used to access the attributes and methods of the class within the class itself.

When you create an object, Python automatically passes the object as the first argument to every method of the class.

By convention, this first argument is named self, but you can name it anything (though it’s not recommended).

Example:

python
Copy
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # self.name refers to the instance's attribute

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"  # self.name accesses the instance's name
4. What is __init__?
__init__ is a special method in Python classes, known as the constructor.

It is automatically called when a new object of the class is created.

It is used to initialize the object's attributes or perform any setup required for the object.

The __init__ method can take parameters (in addition to self) to initialize the object with specific values.

Example:

python
Copy
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Initialize the name attribute
        self.age = age    # Initialize the age attribute

my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)  # Calls __init__ automatically
print(my_dog.name)  # Output: Buddy
print(my_dog.age)   # Output: 3
5. Attributes in a Class
Attributes are variables that belong to an object or a class.

There are two types of attributes:

Instance Attributes: These are specific to each object. They are defined inside the __init__ method using self.

Class Attributes: These are shared by all objects of the class. They are defined directly inside the class.

Example:

python
Copy
class Dog:
    # Class attribute (shared by all objects)
    species = "Canis familiaris"

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        # Instance attributes (specific to each object)
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)
print(my_dog.name)  # Output: Buddy (instance attribute)
print(my_dog.species)  # Output: Canis familiaris (class attribute)
6. Methods in a Class
Methods are functions that belong to a class.

They are used to define the behavior of the objects.

Methods must have self as their first parameter to access the instance's attributes and other methods.

Example:

python
Copy
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    # Instance method
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)
print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: Buddy says woof!
7. Class vs. Instance
Class: A blueprint or template. It defines the structure and behavior of objects.

Instance: A specific object created from a class. Each instance has its own attributes and can call the class's methods.

Example:

python
Copy
class Dog:
    species = "Canis familiaris"  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute
        self.age = age    # Instance attribute

# Creating instances
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)
dog2 = Dog("Max", 5)

print(dog1.name)  # Output: Buddy (instance-specific)
print(dog2.name)  # Output: Max (instance-specific)
print(dog1.species)  # Output: Canis familiaris (shared by all instances)
8. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).

It also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which is achieved using private and protected attributes.

Private Attributes:

Denoted by a double underscore __.

Cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.

Protected Attributes:

Denoted by a single underscore _.

Can be accessed from outside the class but are considered non-public.

Example:

python
Copy
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

account = BankAccount("Alice", 1000)
account.deposit(500)
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500
# print(account.__balance)  # This will raise an AttributeError
9. Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class).

The child class can override or extend the functionality of the parent class.

Example:

python
Copy
class Animal:  # Parent class
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} makes a sound."

class Dog(Animal):  # Child class
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(dog.speak())  # Output: Buddy says woof!
10. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows methods to behave differently based on the object that calls them.

It is often achieved through method overriding (redefining a method in the child class).

Example:

python
Copy
class Bird:
    def fly(self):
        return "This bird can fly."

class Penguin(Bird):
    def fly(self):
        return "This bird cannot fly."

def bird_flying_test(bird):
    print(bird.fly())

bird_flying_test(Bird())  # Output: This bird can fly.
bird_flying_test(Penguin())  # Output: This bird cannot fly.
11. Abstraction
Abstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.

In Python, abstraction can be achieved using abstract base classes (ABCs).

Example:

python
Copy
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2

circle = Circle(5)
print(circle.area())  # Output: 78.5
Summary of Key Concepts:

Object: Instance of a class.

self: Reference to the current instance.

__init__: Constructor method for initializing objects.

Attributes: Variables that belong to an object or class.

Methods: Functions that belong to a class.

Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods, restricting access.

Inheritance: Creating a new class from an existing class.

Polymorphism: Methods behaving differently based on the object.
