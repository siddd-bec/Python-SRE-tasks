1. Conditionals: if, elif, else
Conditionals allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is True or False.

Syntax:
python
Copy
if condition1:
    # Code to execute if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # Code to execute if condition2 is True
else:
    # Code to execute if none of the above conditions are True
Example:
python
Copy
x = 10
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x == 10:
    print("x is exactly 10")
else:
    print("x is less than 10")
Output:

Copy
x is exactly 10
Exercises for Conditionals:
Write a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

Write a program that checks if a number is even or odd.

Write a program that checks if a year is a leap year or not.

Solutions:
Positive, Negative, or Zero:

python
Copy
num = float(input("Enter a number: "))
if num > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif num < 0:
    print("Negative")
else:
    print("Zero")
Even or Odd:

python
Copy
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")
Leap Year:

python
Copy
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
    print("Leap Year")
else:
    print("Not a Leap Year")
2. Loops: for and while
a. for Loop
The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., list, string, range).

Syntax:
python
Copy
for item in sequence:
    # Code to execute for each item
Example:
python
Copy
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
Output:

Copy
0
1
2
3
4
b. while Loop
The while loop repeats a block of code as long as a condition is True.

Syntax:
python
Copy
while condition:
    # Code to execute while condition is True
Example:
python
Copy
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
Output:

Copy
0
1
2
3
4
Exercises for Loops:
Use a for loop to print the first 10 natural numbers.

Use a while loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10.

Write a program to print the multiplication table of a given number using a for loop.

Solutions:
First 10 Natural Numbers:

python
Copy
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
Sum of Numbers from 1 to 10:

python
Copy
total = 0
count = 1
while count <= 10:
    total += count
    count += 1
print("Sum:", total)
Multiplication Table:

python
Copy
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{num} x {i} = {num * i}")
3. Control Flow Statements: break and continue
a. break
The break statement exits the loop immediately.

Example:
python
Copy
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
Output:

Copy
0
1
2
3
4
b. continue
The continue statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.

Example:
python
Copy
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)
Output:

Copy
1
3
5
7
9
Exercises for Control Flow:
Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 but stop if the number is 7.

Write a program to print all numbers from 1 to 20 except multiples of 3.

Write a program to find the first number greater than 100 that is divisible by 17.

Solutions:
Stop at 7:

python
Copy
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i == 7:
        break
    print(i)
Skip Multiples of 3:

python
Copy
for i in range(1, 21):
    if i % 3 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)
First Number > 100 Divisible by 17:

python
Copy
num = 101
while True:
    if num % 17 == 0:
        print(num)
        break
    num += 1
Final Practice Exercise:
Write a program that:

Takes a number as input.

Uses a while loop to keep asking for the number until the user enters a positive number.

Prints the multiplication table of that number using a for loop.

Skips printing the result if the product is a multiple of 5.

Solution:
python
Copy
# Step 1: Keep asking for a positive number
while True:
    num = int(input("Enter a positive number: "))
    if num > 0:
        break
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a positive number.")

# Step 2: Print multiplication table, skipping multiples of 5
for i in range(1, 11):
    product = num * i
    if product % 5 == 0:
        continue
    print(f"{num} x {i} = {product}")
